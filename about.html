        <h1>My story and the things I Like</h1>
        <p>I am Freena S. Koikoi, born unto the union of Mr. Richard Koikoi and Miss. Annie Dorbor.</p>
        <div>As a kid; I started my primary education at the Garden of Life Christian Academy, where I later became the Dux for the school at the end of the school year. In quest for another quality education, I later enroll at the Nathaniel Varney Massaquoi Elementary and Junior High School where I stay and completed my Jr. High studies. During my studies at the N. V. Massaquoi School, I had the opportunity to make some good friends that kept me focus during my studies.</div><br>
        <div>I love to study because I know that with education, I can become a better person in the society and the nation at large. I love to play football and I also love music. Playing football and singing gives me joy. It take away my sadness and I feel comfortable doing it. There are so many things I will like the world to know but i think that I should do it little by little and because of that I am going to stop here.</div><br>
        <div>To conclude, I am a child who wants to study very hard so that i can be able to give back to my society in every single way I can.</div>
