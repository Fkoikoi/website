    <h1>Concepts of Leadership</h1>
    <p>I used to think running an organization was equivalent to conducting a symphony orchestra.</p>
    <div>But I don’t think that’s quite it; it’s more like jazz. There is more improvisation. (Warren Bennis) </div>
    <h2>Definition of Leadership</h2>
    <p>The meaning of a message is he change which it produces in the image.” - Kenneth Boulding in the image: Knowledge in Life and Society</p>
    <p>Leadership is a process by which a person influences others to accomplish an objective and direct the organization in a way that makes it more cohesive and coherent. </p>
    <p>some other popular definitions of Leadership are:</p>
    <p>A process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal (Northouse, 2007, p3). The U.S. military has studied leadership in depth. One of their definitions is a process by which a person influences others to accomplish a mission (U.S. Army, 1983) </p>
<div>Leadership is inspiring others to pursue your vision within the parameters you set, to the extent that it becomes  a shared effort, a shared vision, and a shared success (Zeitchik, 2012). Leadership is process of social influence, which maximizes the efforts of others, towards the achievement of a goal (Kruse, 1983)</div>
